# Machine Learning Workflow

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

1. **Understand the Data Structure:** 
   - Explore the dataset's dimensions (rows and columns).
   - Check the data types of each feature (numerical, categorical, text, etc.).
   - Examine the first few rows of the dataset to get an overview.

2. **Visualize Data Distribution:**
   - Use histograms, box plots, and density plots to visualize the distribution of numerical features.
   - Utilize bar plots, pie charts, and count plots for categorical features.
   - Identify any patterns or anomalies in the data.

3. **Analyze Relationships:**
   - Explore correlations between pairs of numerical features using scatter plots or correlation matrices.
   - Investigate relationships between categorical features using contingency tables or heatmaps.

## Preprocessing

4. **Handle Missing Values:**
   - Identify and handle missing values in the dataset (imputation, deletion, etc.).

5. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Standardize or normalize numerical features to ensure they have a similar scale.

6. **Encode Categorical Variables:**
   - Convert categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.

7. **Deal with Outliers:**
   - Detect and handle outliers in the dataset using methods like trimming, winsorization, or transformation.

8. **Feature Engineering:**
   - Create new features from existing ones to capture additional information or improve model performance.

## Splitting the Dataset

9. **Divide Dataset into Train and Test Sets:**
   - Split the dataset into two subsets: one for training the model and another for evaluating the model's performance.
   - Typically, use a larger portion of data for training (e.g., 70-80%) and a smaller portion for testing (e.g., 20-30%).

## Modeling

10. **Select an Algorithm:**
    - Choose an appropriate machine learning algorithm based on the problem type (classification, regression, clustering, etc.) and data characteristics.

11. **Train the Model:**
    - Fit the selected model to the training data using the `fit` method.

12. **Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional):**
    - Fine-tune the model's hyperparameters using techniques like grid search or random search to optimize performance.

## Evaluation

13. **Assess Model Performance:**
    - Evaluate the trained model's performance using the test set.
    - Compute evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score for classification tasks, or mean squared error, R-squared for regression tasks.

## Iterative Process

14. **Iteratively Improve Model:**
    - Based on evaluation results, iterate on preprocessing steps, try different algorithms, or adjust hyperparameters to enhance the model's performance.
    - Repeat the process until satisfactory performance is achieved.
